# Maker-Checker System - Quick Summary

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

### What Has Been Implemented:

1. **Database Layer**
   - ✅ PendingRecords table created
   - ✅ Maker and Checker roles added
   - ✅ 6 stored procedures for approval workflow
   - ✅ Maker and Checker users created with proper passwords

2. **Backend (C#)**
   - ✅ PendingRecord entity and repository
   - ✅ PendingRecordService with validation logic
   - ✅ UserService updated with pending methods
   - ✅ MakerCheckerController for approval actions
   - ✅ Maker-Checker rule enforcement (Maker ≠ Checker)

3. **Frontend (Views)**
   - ✅ Pending Approvals List
   - ✅ Approved Requests List
   - ✅ Rejected Requests List
   - ✅ Detailed approval/rejection view
   - ✅ Navigation menu updated with Maker-Checker section

4. **Security & Validation**
   - ✅ Role-based authorization
   - ✅ Maker cannot approve own requests
   - ✅ Checker must be different from Maker
   - ✅ Database-level validation
   - ✅ Application-level validation
   - ✅ UI-level role checks

## 🔐 Test Credentials:

| Role    | Username | Password      | Access Rights |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Admin   | admin    | Admin@123     | Full access, can approve |
| Maker   | maker    | Maker@123     | Create requests, cannot approve |
| Checker | checker  | Checker@123   | Can approve/reject only |

## 🚀 How to Test:

### Test Flow 1: Create User as Maker
```
1. Login as maker (maker / Maker@123)
2. Go to Users → Create User
3. Fill form and submit
4. See message: "User creation request submitted for approval"
5. Logout
6. Login as checker (checker / Checker@123)
7. Go to Pending Approvals
8. Click View on the request
9. Review and click Approve
10. User is created automatically!
```

### Test Flow 2: Maker Cannot Self-Approve
```
1. Login as maker
2. Create a user request
3. Try to go to Pending Approvals
4. Try to approve your own request
5. Error: "Checker cannot be the same as Maker"
```

### Test Flow 3: Rejection
```
1. Login as maker
2. Create user request
3. Logout
4. Login as checker
5. Go to Pending Approvals
6. View request and click Reject
7. Enter rejection reason (required)
8. Submit → Request is rejected
9. User is NOT created
```

## 📊 Features:

✅ **CRUD Operations with Approval**
- Create User → Pending → Approved → Executed
- Update User → Pending → Approved → Executed
- Delete User → Pending → Approved → Executed

✅ **Maker-Checker Rules**
- Maker creates requests
- Checker approves/rejects
- Maker ≠ Checker (enforced)
- Admin can do both

✅ **Status Tracking**
- Pending (awaiting approval)
- Approved (executed successfully)
- Rejected (with comments)

✅ **Audit Trail**
- Who created the request (Maker)
- When it was created
- Who approved/rejected (Checker)
- When it was processed
- Comments/reasons

## 🌐 Application URLs:

- **Login**: http://localhost:5100/Auth/Login
- **Dashboard**: http://localhost:5100/Dashboard
- **Users**: http://localhost:5100/User
- **Pending Approvals**: http://localhost:5100/MakerChecker/PendingList
- **Approved List**: http://localhost:5100/MakerChecker/ApprovedList
- **Rejected List**: http://localhost:5100/MakerChecker/RejectedList

## 📝 Database Objects:

### Tables:
- Users (with Maker/Checker users)
- Roles (with Maker/Checker roles)
- PendingRecords (approval queue)

### Stored Procedures:
1. SP_CreatePendingRecord
2. SP_GetAllPendingRecords
3. SP_GetPendingRecordById
4. SP_ApprovePendingRecord
5. SP_RejectPendingRecord
6. SP_ExecuteApprovedUserOperation

## 🎨 UI Features:

- **Color-coded badges**: Pending (yellow), Approved (green), Rejected (red)
- **Operation badges**: Create (green), Update (warning), Delete (danger)
- **Font Awesome icons** for visual clarity
- **Responsive Bootstrap 5** design
- **Role-based UI** (Makers see different options than Checkers)
- **Comments support** (optional for approval, required for rejection)

## ✨ Key Highlights:

1. **Clean Architecture**: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Web
2. **Stored Procedures Only**: All DB operations via SPs
3. **JWT Authentication**: Secure token-based auth
4. **Role-Based Access**: Admin, Maker, Checker roles
5. **Maker-Checker Enforcement**: Cannot approve own requests
6. **JSON Data Storage**: Flexible record data format
7. **Automatic Execution**: Approved operations execute automatically
8. **Complete Audit Trail**: Who, what, when for all actions

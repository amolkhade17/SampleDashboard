// SSL CERTIFICATE TRUST ERROR - RESOLUTION
// ========================================

// ERROR MESSAGE:
// "A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error 
// occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The 
// certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)"

// ROOT CAUSE:
// SQL Server connection string was missing the TrustServerCertificate parameter,
// causing SSL certificate validation to fail when connecting to localhost.

// SOLUTION APPLIED:
// Added "TrustServerCertificate=true" to the connection string in appsettings.json

// BEFORE (BROKEN):
// "Server=localhost;Database=WebAppMVCDb;Trusted_Connection=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"

// AFTER (FIXED):
// "Server=localhost;Database=WebAppMVCDb;Trusted_Connection=true;TrustServerCertificate=true;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"

// WHAT TrustServerCertificate=true DOES:
// - Bypasses SSL certificate validation for the SQL Server connection
// - Safe for development/localhost environments
// - Resolves certificate chain trust issues
// - Allows encrypted connections without requiring valid certificates

// SECURITY NOTE:
// This setting should only be used in development environments or when connecting
// to trusted servers. In production, use proper SSL certificates.

// STATUS: âœ… SSL CONNECTION ERROR RESOLVED
// Login functionality should now work without certificate trust errors.

// TESTING:
// 1. Application runs at http://localhost:5031
// 2. Database connection established successfully
// 3. Ready for login testing with credentials:
//    - admin / admin123
//    - user1 / user123
